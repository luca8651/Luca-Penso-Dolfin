# Luca-Penso-Dolfin
I have a background in Molecular and Evolutionary Biology, and have been working in Bioinformatics for several years, both in academic and industry settings.

For the last four years, I worked as a bioinformatician at Silence Therapeutics GmbH in Berlin. I lead the conceptualization and development of bioinformatics pipelines for RNA-seq analysis, studied the RNAi mechanism and built machine-learning models to predict siRNA off-target genes. 

Before joining Silence, I had the pleasure to work in several interdisciplinary academic groups. I worked extensively in comparative and evolutionary genomics, leading many studies on microRNA evolution and in silico target site prediction. I built an expertise on annotating novel microRNA genes in vertebrate genomes, using smallRNA sequencing data. I have also gained experience in the identification of Structural Variants from DNA-seq data, and applied these skills to both cancer and genome evolution projects. At DKFZ in Heidelberg, I lead a project investigating cancer resistance mechanisms in the naked mole-rat skin, using Whole Exome and single-cell RNA-seq data.
